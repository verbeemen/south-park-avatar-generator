# South-Park Avatar Generator

The goal of this project is to create a small South-Park Avatar generator which we can later use into another project.  
(more specifically: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05139.pdf)

This project contains out of 2 main parts:
 - A notebook which downloads all the required images
   - download_southpark_items.ipynb
   
   
   
 - A class which is able to generate (random) south park cartoons. 
   - southParkAvatarGenerator.ipynb
   - southParkAvatarGenerator.py
  
  
 For more info, I would suggest to open the notebooks
  
# Example
The next images were randomly generated by our South-Park avatar generator.
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="./nb_imgs/example_0.png" style='width:320px'></td>
        <td><img src="/nb_imgs/example_1.png" style='width:320px'></td>
        <td><img src="nb_imgs/example_2.png" style='width:320px'></td>
    </tr>
</table>
